EIC 3D Alpha 4.9 User Guide

EIC 3D (Alpha 4.9 version) is a standalone application you can use to view hit
and ECal/HCal cluster data within a virtual environment in the ATHENA detector. 
This version is currently available for use on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Desktop version requirements here:

INSTALLATION

Download link: https://github.com/SeanBP/EIC-3D/tree/main/EIC%203D%20Download

To use the program, download the version for the platform you are using. Unzip the
folder in your desired location. Within this folder (or for MacOS, the folder itself), 
you will find an application file with the ATHENA logo. When opened, this will start the application. 

For Windows, the first time you attempt to open it, you will get an error saying "Windows protected your PC". Click "More info" and then "Run anyway".

For MacOS, the first time you attempt to open it, you will get an error saying it can't be opened.
After pressing "OK" on this error, navigate to "System Preferences" and "Security and Privacy".
Then, where it says ""EIC 3D Alpha [V] MacOS " was blocked..." press "Open Anyway" and then "Open".

For Windows, you may create a shortcut for the EIC application to place on your Desktop.


CONTROLS / NAVIGATION

Once the application is started, you will be able to control the movement of
a camera within a virtual environment displaying a simplified model of the ATHENA
detector.

To move the camera, use the "W" "A" "S" "D" "Shift" and "Space" keys.
To look in different directions, move your mouse / touchpad.

To display event data and modify the detector model, open the menu using the "E" key
and use your cursor to navigate into the Event Menu or the Detector Menu. Close the menu again with the "E" key.

Within the event menu, you may set the speed at which animations play. This is done by entering what you would like to set as the speed of light (in m/s). By default this will be 3 m/s.

To exit the application, open the menu using the "E" key, and select "Exit Program" using your cursor.


DISPLAYING DATA

The program comes pre-installed with sample collision data, but you can display your own data by modifying
the text file at the location listed below:

Windows: "EIC 3D Alpha [V] Windows/EIC 3D_Data/StreamingAssets/Events.txt"
Mac: Right click the application and select "Show Package Contents", then navigate to "Contents/Resources/Data/StreamingAssets/Events.txt"
Linux:"EIC 3D Linux Alpha 4.8/EIC 3D Alpha [V] Linux_Data/StreamingAssets/Events.txt"

The current syntax is used:
Each event is preceded by the word "Event" on its own line.
Under "Event", the word "Hit" is listed on its own line to indicate hit data.
Under "Hit", each line is used as coordinate data of a single hit point, with information listed as:
[time (ns)] [x (m)] [y (m)] [z (m)] [E (MeV)]
For white hits, set energy to 0.
For black hits, set energy to -1.
Following these, the word "Clusters" is listed to indicate cluster data.
Under "Clusters", each line is used as coordinate data of a single cluster, with information listed as:
[Ecal/Hcal] [Endcap/Barrel] [x (m)] [y (m)] [z (m)] [E (MeV)]
Under cluster data, "Event" is used to indicate data from the next event, and this syntax is looped until there is no more remaining data.


DISPLAYING DETECTOR COMPONENTS

The program comes pre-installed with a detector model, but you can display your own model by modifying
the text file at the location listed below:

Windows: "EIC 3D Windows Alpha 4.8/EIC 3D_Data/StreamingAssets/Detector.txt"
Mac: Right click the application and select "Show Package Contents", then navigate to "Contents/Resources/Data/StreamingAssets/Detector.txt"
Linux:"EIC 3D Linux Alpha 4.8/EIC 3D Linux Alpha 4.8_Data/StreamingAssets/Detector.txt"

Each component is displayed as an annulus regular right frustum oriented along the beam line. The current syntax is used:

The name of a component is written on a line to indicate that the parameters of that component are on the following line.
In the next line, the parameters of the component are listed as:
[sides] [inner vertex radius (negative side)] [outer radius (negative side)] [inner vertex radius (positive side)] [outer radius (positive side)] [outer barrel length] [inner barrel length] [outer barrel offset along beam axis] [inner barrel offset relative to outer barrel]  [R] [G] [B]
The name of the next component is listed on the next line, and its parameters on the line after that, and so on until there are no more components.

All units are in meters. R, G, B values represent the color of the detector, where each is a value from 0 to 255.
Components should be listed from the innermost components to the outermost components, for them to render properly.
If a circular shape is desired, simply set [sides] to be 51.
