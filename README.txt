EIC 3D

The goal of this project is to create a new, user-friendly, easily
modifiable event display for the ATHENA detector at the future
Electron-Ion Collider.

Currently, this project is in its Alpha stage and is not yet ready
for wide public distribution, and will be updated frequently.

From here, you will find three folders. The "EIC 3D" folder contains
the Unity project being developed. You are free to use the code in
this open-source project, per the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0.

The "EIC 3D VRChat" folder contains the Unity project uploaded to the
game VRChat, a free-to-play multiplayer game with VR compatability.
To play this, simply download VRChat on your desired platform, and
search for the world "EIC 3D" under Community Labs.

Finally, the "EIC 3D Download" folder contains the download files and
instructions for the standalone EIC 3D application, currently
available for MacOS, Linux, and Windows. See the README in this
folder for further instructions.

The download files will always be held at this link:
